#my first case 77932 involves stale nfsv3 filehandles, here's what the `umount` man page
says for `umount -lf`


-l, --lazy
              Lazy  unmount.   Detach  the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now, and cleanup all refer‐
              ences to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore.  (Requires kernel 2.4.11 or later.)

              A system reboot would be expected in near future if you're going to use this option  for  network
              filesystem or local filesystem with submounts.  The recommended use-case for umount -l is to pre‐
              vent hangs on shutdown due to an unreachable network share where a normal umount will hang due to
              a downed server or a network partition. Remounts of the share will not be possible.


-f == force
